## Specifications

### Overview

```txt
./demo
|---- README.md    // Project structures, specs, etc.
|---- web_api      // Backend sub-project
|---- web_app      // Frontend sub-project
|---- docs         // Engineering documentations
```

Two main components for project:

- Backend API
- Frontend web application

**Note:**

- Frontend web app is built and delivered by backend api at root
- To run the demo on your local, please re-create virtual environment with dependency listed in `web_api/requirements.txt` then execute the `wsgi.py` with the venv's Python
- To run the frontend only, change directory to `web_app/hateless` then run `npm run start`

### 1. Backend

- **Flask 2.0.2**: WSGI web application frame work [BSD License]
- **Gunicorn 20.1.0**: Also WSGI framework, but supports workers feature extension to **Flask** sequential request processing model
- **Scikit-learn**: ML library to load picked models by ML team (I picked )
  
### 2. Frontend

- **ReactJS 11.7.1**: JavaScript library for Web UI
- **MUI 5.2**: A React component library following Google's **Material UI**

#### Getting started
```txt
./demo/web_app/hateless
|---- package.json        // A manifest file, contains dependencies and operation cmds
|---- package-lock.json   // Auto-generated by npm, must be checked into source control
|---- public/             // Static files (default)
|---- src/                // Main source for React components
```

**Dependencies**

- react
- mui

**How to run**

Go to `./demo/web_app/hateless` directory (the one contains `package.json`). More React tutorials are available at [ReactJS official documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)

```
npm install       # npm installs dependencies and saves it to ./node_modules
npm run start     # react is built and deployed locally
```

If you just want to use a model then execute the following command __from
the repository's root__ (requires the training set to be available at
this_repository/resources/training_data.csv):
```
python -m demo.web_api.main
```
